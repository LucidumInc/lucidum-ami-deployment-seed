# Lucidum deployment seed


This repository contains the necessary code to boot Lucidum product across multiple cloud providers.

[amazon_aws_community](amazon_aws_community/README.md) Code to boot Community Lucidum version on Amazon cloud

[amazon_aws_enterprise](amazon_aws_enterprise/README.md) Code to boot Enterprise Lucidum version on Amazon cloud

[google_compute](google_compute/README.md) Code to boot Enterprise Lucidum on Google cloud

[microsoft_azure](microsoft_azure/README.md) Code to boot Enterprise Lucidum on Microsoft cloud

[boot_scripts](boot_scripts/README.md) Scripts used by Terraform / Cloudformation / On-Premises (VMware, OpenStack, etc) 


### AWS cross account assume role

[x_account_deployment](x_account_deployment/README.md) directory for sub-account stack execution.

- Terraform and Cloudformation support in `x_account_deployment` subdirectory
  * Role is created in subaccounts with proper IAM Role and Policy
  * Terraform support via `terraform [init|apply]`
  * Cloudformation support via cfn wrapper `bash cloudformation.sh`

- Main-account supports iam policy by default and requires no additional action.
  * Main-account iam instance role resources created automatically as part of main stack.
  * Main-account trust itself and may be treated like sub-accounts.

### AWS cross account assume role batch script

`x_account_deployment.sh` will allow the creation of roles accross multiple AWS accounts in batch mode. This script will iterate thru a list of AWS CLI profiles, and execute the necessary Terraform (default) or Cloudformation in each subaccount.

`x_account_deployment.sh` will execute in Terraform mode by default. If Cloudformation mode is prefered, add the `cloudformation` argument to the script, such as: `bash x_account_deployment.sh cloudformation`. NOTE: Cloudformation does not cleanly cleanup on failures, so may need to clean up cfn stacks in subaccounts on failures, such as due to erroneous TRUST_ACCOUNT value.


### System Resources

We recommend the following minimum resources:
`memory 128G`
`cpu 16 cores`
`hard drive 1T SSD`
