### AWS cross account assume role

`x_account_deployment` directory for child account stack execution

- main-account supports assume role by default and requires no additional action.
  * main-account terraform assume role resources created automatically as part of main stack.
  * main-account trusts itself and is treated like sub-accounts.

- sub-accounts require additional configuration step.
  * each sub-account must execute terraform in `x_account_deployment` subdirectory as terraform root.
